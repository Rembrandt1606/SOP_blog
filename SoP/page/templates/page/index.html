                    To achieve that end, it must articulate your potential for success in your program’s area of study; whether that be research for MS/PhDs, business acumen for MBAs, law for JDs, or medicine for MDs/DOs.
                    As I distinctly recall the difficulty I faced when writing my SoP, I wanted to provide others with a framework that I know was successful, and highlight the reasons I think it was.</p>
                <!--<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 2vh; text-indent: 30px;">Writting a SoP can feel like like an arcane process, where your are instucted to talk about "you".</p>-->

                         As I stood there, I realized that the six seconds the algorithm took to run was far too long in a life-or-death situation.</a> As systems architects continue
                         to push the boundaries of application to solve complex problems, we must address the power and performance needs they require. <a href="#" id="part_2" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="focus" data-content=

                         motivation in a cogent manner.">With an M.S. in Computer Engineering, I intend to work adjacent to the semiconductor industry to design energy efficient, powerful, and affordable computing solutions that are accessible for engineers.</a></p>

                        highlighting my technical ability. Additionally, I draw connections to large contemporary issues that imporvements in current computer architecture techology could potentionally solve.">I became motivated to advance the field of computer 
                        architecture while working on my senior project at UCR. When my senior design team recognized that the trend of worsening wildfires in California are likely to continue, we sought to design our project to assist firefighters in locating 
                        injured victims.</a> I ensured the system detected people, while maintaining a lifespan of an hour. Although my work was sufficient for the course, I found it to be untenable in the intended working environment.<a href="#" id="part_4"

                        insight to me in a way that is condusive to potential success in a graduate program."> I believe the greatest improvements for our design lie at the architecture level – as improvements here offer a more powerful, longer lasting, and more 
                        affordable product that is easier to implement at scale. I went on to take courses in high-frequency circuits and solid-state electronics to expand my knowledge of the subject and help me tackle larger scale problems in research and industry.</a></p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">I was driven to pursue research, so I sought to grow my abilities at UCR’s Video Computing Group. While there, I assisted my graduate student team member in automating his image analysis to detect cancer cells using the 
                        bioinformatics tool BisQue. <a href="#" id="part_5" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-trigger="focus" data-content="The reserach statement is perhaps the most important paragraph in any SOP, as it shows you understand the primary purpose 
                        of your graduate degree. In this paragraph, I clearly mention what I learned in my reserach lab and how I believe these skills will be beneficial in the future. Notice that even thought I did not publish any papers I still acknowlege the skills I developed.">
                        This taught me how to work with data and modify research tools when needed. I went on to create a real-time web demonstration of a model recently published by the group. Completing this project developed my ability to work independently while being on a team of researchers.</a></p>

                         systems offer solutions to the problems of climate change, and I intend to develop these systems. Climate scientists can better model atmospheric behavior, energy efficient data centers can reduce emissions, and advancements in AI systems can enable applications thought out of reach.</a>
                         These problems pose different challenges for future systems and UIUC’s program is particularly well suited to enhancing my abilities to confront them.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The diversity in faculty and flexibility of courses offer me the scope required to tackle these problems and make UIUC particularly interesting. <a href="#" id="part_7" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-trigger="focus" data-content="Finally my

                         on nanowires and electronics, Professor Goddard’s work on photonic integrated circuits, and Professor Bayram’s work on next-generation platforms all offer me the potential to learn various approaches for next generation systems from some of the best in the field.</a> Courses such as “Optical Electronics”
